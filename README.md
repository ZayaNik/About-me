# About-me

My name is Zornitsa and I live in Burgas, Bulgaria.

I graduated in Software Engineering in Burgas Free University. I had the opportunity to practice some of the main programming languages such as java, c#, c++ and so on, but it gives me the most pleasure to deal with the user interface (UI). And there is nothing better than loving your job. That's why I want to be a frontend developer.

Programming languages I work with JavaScript React HTML5 CSS

I will publish my first project soon.
